# NeuralSyntax Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for NeuralSyntax.

## Short-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Refine and expand the core language concept document
- Gather community feedback on the initial concept
- Explore potential prototype implementations of key components
- Establish collaboration with researchers in AI and programming language design

## Medium-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Develop proof-of-concept implementations of:
  - Basic NeuralSyntax interpreter
  - Simple translation layer to common programming languages
- Create formal specification of the language
- Begin benchmarking protocols for efficiency claims

## Long-term Goals (1-3 years)
- Full implementation of NeuralSyntax ecosystem
- Integration with major AI code generation tools
- Development of tooling and IDE support
- Performance optimization and validation
- Expansion to specialized domains (medical, financial, embedded systems)

## Get Involved
We prioritize tasks based on community interest and availability of contributors. If you'd like to help with any of these goals, please check the [Issues](../../issues) section for specific tasks or open a new issue to discuss your ideas.
