# NeuralSyntax Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the project. Here are a few guidelines:

1. **Issues**  
   - If you have an idea, question, or found an error in the concept description, open a new [issue](https://github.com/Dreips/NeuralSyntax/issues).
   - Try to describe the topic concisely and clearly.

2. **Pull Requests**  
   - If you develop corrections to documents or code prototypes, you can create a PR.
   - Always include a brief description of what you're changing and why.

3. **Discussions**  
   - You can start or join a discussion in [Discussions](https://github.com/Dreips/NeuralSyntax/discussions) to get community feedback.

4. **Repository Structure**  
   - Concept documentation is located in the `docs/` directory.
   - Main overview is in `docs/CONCEPT.md`.
   - Detailed specification is in `docs/NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md`.
   - Target code (if it appears) will have its own directory structure.

5. **License**  
   - Everything you contribute to the project is covered by the [MIT](LICENSE) license.
