# NeuralSyntax – Concept

## Goal
NeuralSyntax aims to create a new, internal programming language that will be:

1. **Super-compact** – minimizing the number of tokens needed to describe complex functionalities.
2. **Neuromorphic** – modeled after the architecture of biological neural networks, which may facilitate natural information processing by AI models.
3. **Easily compilable** into multiple target languages (C++, Python, Java, Rust, etc.).

## Scope
- Documentation and specification of the notation format (syntax).
- Proposals for translators and compilers (conceptually).
- Possible implementations in the future – community contributions welcome.

## Development Vision
1. **Phase 1 (Current)** – Defining basic assumptions, conceptual discussion within the open source community.
2. **Phase 2** – Prototypes of parsers and translators that will be able to transform "NeuralSyntax IR" into a selected programming language.
3. **Phase 3** – Expansion of the ecosystem of libraries, debugging and optimization tools.

## Potential Applications
- AI systems generating code (e.g., similar to GitHub Copilot, but operating at a more internal level).
- Optimization of large projects (e.g., in cloud, DevOps), where automatic code generation and refactoring are key.

## We Invite Collaboration
- We welcome suggestions and technical solutions in the form of pull requests.
- If you have an idea for a practical implementation fragment, e.g., a parser in Python, please share it in the repository.

## Documentation Structure

This repository contains two main conceptual documents:

1. **CONCEPT.md** (this file) - A concise overview of the NeuralSyntax project
2. **[NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md](NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md)** - Comprehensive technical documentation

We recommend starting with this overview before diving into the detailed specifications.

## Areas Needing Further Development

> **TODO:** The following areas could benefit from more detailed exploration:
> 
> 1. Formal specification of the syntax notation
> 2. Token optimization strategies
> 3. Initial proof-of-concept implementations
> 4. Benchmarking methodology to validate efficiency claims
