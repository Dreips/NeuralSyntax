# NeuralSyntax – Open Source Concept

**NeuralSyntax** is an open concept for a dedicated programming language designed to optimize code generation by AI systems. The project aims to create documentation and potentially future software prototypes that:

- **Enable an internal code representation** (IR) optimized for token minimization and rapid generation.
- **Inspire the community** to collaborate and jointly develop tools based on this idea.
- **Allow experimentation** with neuromorphic structures and code-generating AI models.

## Project Status
- Currently no production code – the concept is at the theoretical description stage.
- All interested parties are welcome to contribute ideas and prototypes, report issues, open discussions, etc.

## Repository Files
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) – License terms (MIT).
- [docs/CONCEPT.md](docs/CONCEPT.md) – Document describing the main principles and vision of NeuralSyntax.
- [docs/NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md](docs/NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md) – Comprehensive technical documentation.

## How Can I Help?
1. Add a new [issue](../../issues) with suggestions, questions, or bugs.
2. If you create a prototype or want to share code, submit a [pull request](../../pulls).
3. Participate in discussions in the [Discussions](../../discussions) section.

## Where to Start?
- Read [docs/CONCEPT.md](docs/CONCEPT.md) to understand the main principles of NeuralSyntax.
- Review [docs/NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md](docs/NeuralSyntax-language-concept.md) for detailed technical specifications.
